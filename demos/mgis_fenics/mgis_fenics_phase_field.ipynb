    "## Introduction on phase-field approaches to brittle fracture\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase-field approach to brittle fracture originates from the mathematical regularization of Francfort \\& Marigo variational approach of fracture [@francfort1998revisiting]. Following mathematical works of [@ambrosio1990approximation], the regularization proposed by [@bourdin2000numerical] relies on the following total energy $\\mathcal{E}(u, d) = \\mathcal{E}_\\text{pot}(u,d)+\\mathcal{E}_\\text{frac}(d)$ where the potential and fracture energies respectively read as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathcal{E}_\\text{pot}(u,d) &= \\int_\\Omega g(d)\\dfrac{1}{2}\\bvarepsilon:\\mathbb{C}:\\bvarepsilon \\dx - W_{ext}(u) \\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{E}_\\text{frac}(d) &= \\dfrac{G_c}{c_w} \\int_{\\Omega}\\left( \\frac{w(d)}{\\ell_0} + \\ell_0 \\|\\nabla d\\|^2 \\right)\\dx\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "in which \n",
    "\n",
    "* $u$ is the displacement field and $W_{ext}(u)$ is the work of external forces\n",
    "* $d\\in[0;1]$ is a continuous field representing the fracture location ($d=1$) in a *smeared* fashion\n",
    "* $\\ell_0$ is a small regularization length-scale parameter\n",
    "* $g(d)$ is continuous strictly-decreasing degradation function\n",
    "* $w(d)$ a continuous strictly-increasing function\n",
    "* $c_w$ a numerical constant associated with $w$\n",
    "\n",
    "> This formulation exhibits extremely strong links with damage gradient models [@pham2011gradient] so that $d$ is often referred to as a damage variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions to the quasi-static evolution at discrete time steps $(u_n,d_n)$ are obtained from a global energy minimum principle on both variables with an additional irreversibility constraint $d_n\\geq d_{n-1}$ for the damage variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This original formulation does not distinguish between tensile and compressive stress states, yielding spurious crack formation in compressive regions. A commonly used remedy consists in splitting the energy density $\\psi$ into a positive (associated with tension states) and negative (compressive states) part and apply the degradation function only on the positive part i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

Note that we also provide an implementation of the spectral splitting introduced by [@miehe2010phase] in the [`PhaseFieldDisplacementSpectralSplit.mfront` file](materials/PhaseFieldDisplacementSpectralSplit.mfront).\n",
    "\n",
    "A classical choice for the degradation function is $g(d)=(1-d)^2 + k_\\text{res}$ where $k_\\text{res} \\ll 1$ is a residual stiffness avoiding singular stiffness in the fully damaged state.  \n",
    "As regards the fracture energy density, two choices originating from the work of Ambrosio and Tortorelli (AT) are widely used, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "In this demo we will use the AT2 model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numerical resolution techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "A classical approach for computing the solution at load increment $n$ is to resort to a so-called *alternate minimization* scheme which involves the following steps embedded in an iterative procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "u^k &= \\argmin_u \\mathcal{E}(u, d^{k-1}) \\tag{$u$-problem}\\\\\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step ($u$-problem) of this staggered solution scheme therefore involves solving the following non-linear mechanical problem at fixed damage:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textrm{Find } u\\in V_u \\text{ s.t. } \\int_\\Omega \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(u,d_{k-1}):\\operatorname{sym}\\nabla \\widehat{u} \\,\\text{dx} = W_{ext}(\\widehat{u}) \\quad \\forall \\widehat{u}\\in V_u\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(u,d)=g(d)\\dfrac{\\partial \\psi^+}{\\partial \\bvarepsilon}(u)+\\dfrac{\\partial \\psi^-}{\\partial \\bvarepsilon}(u)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step ($d$-problem) amounts to solving a variational inequality problem due to the presence of the irreversibility constraint $d_{n-1} \\leq d$. A simple way of enforcing, implicitly, this irreversibility constraint has been proposed in [@miehe2010phase] by resorting to a so-called *history function* which correspond to the maximal value of the tensile energy density $\\psi^+$ over the past loading history:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H = \\max_{m \\leq n}\\{\\psi^+(\\bvarepsilon_m)\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, the irreversibility constraint is dropped and the current tensile energy $\\psi^+$ is substituted by $H$ in the $d$-problem. The optimality condition therefore yields the following variational problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textrm{Find } d\\in V_d \\text{ s.t. } \\int_\\Omega \\left(g'(d)H\\widehat{d}+\\dfrac{G_c}{\\ell_0c_w}\\left(w'(d)\\widehat{d} + 2\\ell_0^2 \\nabla d \\cdot \\nabla \\widehat{d}\\right)\\right) \\,\\text{dx} = 0 \\quad \\forall \\widehat{d}\\in V_d  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that this approach loses the original variational for of the phase-field formulation. In particular, no theoretical results establishing the equivalence with the original constrained minimization problem exist. This approach is however widespread due to its simplicity."
